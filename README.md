#Exploring change detection using satellite imagery!

I've recently worked on a change detection project in Google Earth Engine, analyzing the changes in my area of interest between 2019 and 2020 using Sentinel-2 data. This technique leverages cloud-free imagery and powerful data processing tools to visualize environmental changes, which could be valuable for applications like urban planning, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

By applying filters for date, cloud percentage, and selecting the right bands for visualizing land cover changes, I've created a visual comparison of the area across the two years.

üîç Key Insights:

1.Utilized Sentinel-2 data for high-resolution analysis.
2.Applied cloud filtering for clean, reliable results.
3.Showcased the potential of Google Earth Engine in change detection.
4.Looking forward to exploring more and improving my skills in geospatial data analysis!
